The canteen service is framed within the Educational Project of the school and includes two different areas: the dining room and the activities that children carry out at midday hours, both under the control, surveillance and animation of the monitors.

This service also aims to provide students with balanced nutrition, helping them live together during dinner and leisure activities. That is why, from the dining room, a healthy and balanced diet is encouraged, as well as correct eating habits.

From the school we manage and coordinate the dining service at the level of registrations, cancellations, modifications and global operation and delegates, to the company HOSTESA, the management, the monitoring, the activities and the elaboration of the food.</p>

The beautiful garden of my school campus has sunflowers, roses, daisies, marigolds, sunflowers, tulips, etc.The garden also comprises fruit-bearing trees such as Mango trees, Orange trees, Guava trees, Pomegranate trees, etc. On ripening, these fruits are distributed among the students of my school.After having lunch, I love spending time in my school garden admiring its beauty. </p>
